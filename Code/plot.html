</div>
<div class="plot">
    <p><img src="Images/trilogy.jpg" alt="trilogy">"The Lord of the Rings" is a movie sequence containing three fictional adventurous films directed by Peter Jackson. The trilogy was created according to the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. The movies are called "The Fellowship of the Ring", "The Two Towers" and "The Return of the King" which were released in respectively 2001, 2002 and 2003. The films were one of the major movie projects ever. The trilogy was shot in a period of eight years concurrently and completely in New Zealand. Each movie had a prolonged version out on DVD. The movies were a huge success, winning 17 out of 30 Academy Awards nominations. The last one, "Return of the king" won all of its 11 nominations.</p>

<div class="plot">
    <p><img src="Images/fellowship.jpg" alt="fellowship">The first movie, "Fellowship of the Ring" tells the story of how in early times nineteen rings of power were forged (three for the elves, seven for the dwarfs and nine for men). The dark lord, Sauron, created "the one ring" making it so powerful that he can rule all others. However, it was lost and destiny places it in the hands of Frodo Baggins who becomes the ringbearer and is tasked to bring it to Mount Doom where it was crafted and destroy it by throwing it in the fire. He is joined by Gandalf the wizard, Aragorn, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Boromor and three other hobbits - Sam, Merry and Pippin. They all form the Fellowship which starts their journey through snow, treacherous mountains and dark forests fighting evil along the way.</p>
</div>

<div class="plot">
    <p><img src="Images/towers.jpg" alt="towers">In the second movie, "The two towers", the members of the Fellowship get separated. At the same time Sauron's might is rising. Frodo and Sam head together towards Mordor where they meet the creature Gollum which is completely overwhelmed by the power of the one ring. In the meantime, Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf and Gimli go to look for Merry and Pippin who are captured by Saurons's soldiers - the orcs. Later on they get together with new allies from Rohan. They unite against Sauron's puppet - Saruman. Meanwhile, Sauron is preparing to attack Gondor. The War for the ring begins.</p>
</div>
<div class="plot">
    <p><img src="Images/king.jpg" alt="king">The third and final movie, "The Return of the King" begins with Gondor being attacked by the orcs of Mordor, while Gandalf journeys to Minas Tirith to help the men in the upcoming battle. Aragorn must understand his true destiny as King of Men and rides with Legolas and Gimli to obtain a new ally - The army of the Dead. While all others are doing everything possible to distract the eye of Sauron, Frodo and Sam are faced with their darkest fears as they walk upon the treacherous path to Mount Doom which is the only place where the one ring can be destroyed. </p>
