    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>This website was created for "Lord of the Rings" fans. It features plots of the three films and displays their movie posters. Moreover, information, images, video and corresponding audio themes about the characters and cast have been included. The different races in the trilogy have been described. Images of the places where the movies were filmed are added as well as a video about visiting them. There is also a map with all locations from the fantasy world of the trilogy, called Middle Earth. Finally, an entire page is dedicated to videos from behind the scenes. This website was created using WebStorm. It includes additional features such as a slideshow, displaying current date and time and "Go to top" of the page button. These were created using JavaScript.</p>
    <h1>Accessibility</h1>
    <p>The website is accessible through any browser and can be read on smaller screens as well, including mobile devices. All pages and multimedia files are stored correctly in order to be available for the user. Content can be read without the style sheets and no blinking, moving or scrolling objects or pages have been added in order to make the appearance simpler. All videos and audios can be controlled (play, pause, allow fullscreen and mute). No multimedia features an autoplay as that can be annoying for some users. Navigation bar is clear and easy to use. When scrolling down through a page, the user can go back to the top anytime they want by clicking a button on the right bottom corner. Content is clear and easily understandable. The "alt" attribute was used to provide an alternative text to all images. The font can be considered fancy, but is easily readable. The font is very important to the theme of the website(Lord of the rings trilogy), therefore cannot be changed. The background is quite simple, almost white so that the text is not poorly contrasted.</p>
    <h1>Security</h1>
    <p>Security will be considered in terms of all pages will be available and stored properly so that no user gets error 404 when trying to access the website. A proper SSL certificate will be considered in order to minimize risks of hackers manipulating the database and ensuring overall security. Users will be prompted to provide strong passwords which are at least eight characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter and a special character. Sensitive data will be encrypted in order to ensure that no unauthorized users access it. There will be control access policy meaning that only certain group of individuals will be granted access to the databases. HTTPS will be implemented to secure personal information and make users feel safe when providing sensitive data such as name, address, login credentials and others. The hosting server will be thoroughly researched in order to use the most secured one. Additional features will be added to the hosting package in terms of SSL certificate and backup. The hosting will also include email hosting, unlimited bandwidth, and will be made sure that it can be trusted. That will be done by researching which companies use this particular hosting.</p>
    <h1>Future</h1>
    <p>This website will be enhanced in the future by implementing the above mentioned accessibility and security features. Its content will also be extended, but the design will remain simple. The website will contain more information about the trilogy and more videos where the user can get to know the actors better and become more familiar with what is happening behind the scenes. Moreover, the website visitations will be tracked by using Google Analytics. It will be registered on Google and a suitable hosting will be implemented.</p>
